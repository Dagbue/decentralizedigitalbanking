            Are Bill Pay payments sent by check or as an electronic payment?
          </summary>
          <p>It depends on the merchant receiving the payment. We attempt to send as many electronic payments as possible.

            Can I get both eDocuments and paper statements?
          </summary>
          <p>
            You can have eDocuments or paper statements, but not both.

            How much will I save by switching to eDocuments?
          </summary>
          <p>Switching to eDocuments will save you the $3.00 per paper statement fee.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            Are eDocuments safer than paper statements?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Yes. About 85% of identity theft cases are due to paper transactions, lost checkbooks and stolen bills,
            statements and check payments.
